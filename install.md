### Software installation

* Since we have limited number of desktops here, some of you might need to use your own computer.

##### SSH and SCP

SSH is used to log into remote server and scp is used to copy files between server and your laptop. Both tools comes default with Linux and Mac OS. However, we need the X Environment here so you can . For Mac OS, please install the [Xquartz](http://www.xquartz.org/). For linux user, I think it should be installed by default.

##### Paraview
Paraview is used for visualization. It is open-source software, download from [here](http://www.paraview.org/download/).

##### Trelis

Trelis is used for mesh. It is a commercial software. Thanks to the support from Trelis group, we got several license. We will distribute the license on some desktops. After the workshop, the license should be deactivated.
