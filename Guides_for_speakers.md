### Guides for Speakers

##### 1. Storage directory

Copy the shared content at `/scratch/fast`, including source code, and data.

##### 2. Slides and instructions

  * It is also recommended to write a simple instructions, for example, key terminal commands in the instructions. Since we got students from different programming levels, it is important for keep for instructions simple and straight-forward.
  * Please include sponsors in your slides and instructions, for example, Trelis
  * Please bring you own laptop to present if you feel comfortable to. I will also take the a loaner computer from the department in case if you don't want to use your own.

##### 3. Connection
There are two ports available for the mcmillan server.
  * mcmillan2
  * mcmillan-vis

For people using desktops in the NMC, they can connect to either ports. For people using wireless network, they have to ssh through mcmillan-vis. Don't forget to use `-X` to activiate X11 environment.

##### 4. Account information
I have put a file at `/scratch/fast/lei/guest_users.txt` in case you need it.

TODO:
  1. Trelis and Paraview is not yet installed on the PCs there. We need to do it tomorrow.
  2. I might miss one or two Macs to install the Xquartz. I will do it tomorrow.
